In many cases for website work, you’ll need image files in scalable vector graphics (SVG) format instead of pixel-based formats, such as JPEG and PNG.

Customers who can clearly see what they’re contemplating buying have a lot more faith in the seller and are more willing to trust you with their purchase!

Hiring professional translators is the only way to ensure that people who read your business information in one language understand the sentiment and intention you want to convey. Avoid the temptation to just use an online translation tool. That’s because, when you just translate the words, you can lose the meaning, which is particularly important with marketing or promotional material"},{question:"What are a few points I should keep in mind before hiring a freelance translator?",answer:"If you’re planning to hire a freelance translator, look for someone who is a native speaker of the target language you want to translate into. That will ensure that the audience you want to reach will understand your material. It’s also a good idea to find someone who specialises in the area you’re most interested in, like legal, medical, marketing and so on. As always, check your translator’s qualifications, and look for reviews and references that back up the translator’s expertise."},{question:"Machine translation vs. human translation. What's best?",answer:"While machine translation can help with translating basic, common words and phrases, human certified translation is much better. That’s because machines aren’t as good as humans at working out the writer’s intention. That means they won’t always select the appropriate translation for a particular word, phrase, or sentence. If you use machine translation alone, the overall translation won’t be of a good quality. A good middle ground can be to have a machine translation reviewed by a human certified translator."},{question:"Can I do anything to help the translation process?",answer:"You can help the translation process by providing clear, easy to understand source material for translation. It’s also a good idea to inform your translator about the audience for the document being translated so the translator can be sure to use the appropriate style and tone. That aside, most translators will let you know if there are any special requirements. It’s wise to check that your translator specialises in the area you need before making the final decision."},{question:"Do I need a separate proofreading service?",answer:"When you hire a translator, you don’t always need a separate proofreading service. Many translators include proofreading as part of the translation service.They’ll check to make sure that the final translation reads well, makes sense, and is faithful to the original document.

If you want to make sure, consider hiring a professional proofreader to make a final check of your document before you use or publish it."},{question:"How can I trust that translations are accurate and culturally relevant?",answer:"The best way to get accurate, culturally relevant translations is to hire a professional translator who is a native speaker of the language you are translating into. That expertise will help the translator accurately convey any nuances or special meanings from your original text by using the appropriate words and phrases in the final document. If you’re unsure, consider getting another native speaker to proofread the translation so you can be sure it meets your needs."}]},109:{faqs:[{question:"What are the benefits of using transcription services?",answer:"Accurate transcription services offer several benefits. One of the main ones is extending the reach of your content by targeting people who prefer to consume content in different formats. Transcribing audio and video content makes it easy to repurpose it in blog posts, ebooks, and articles. And having transcribed content in podcast and video show notes is good for SEO. That means people will be able to find your content in search results more easily."},{question:"What is a standard transcription process?",answer:"Both audio transcription and video transcription start by supplying the source file or URL to the transcriber. Then the transcriber listens to the file and types out what they hear. After that, the transcript is double-checked to make sure nothing is missed. If there is content that’s hard to hear or understand, this is marked as inaudible in the transcript. Transcripts can include recording timings, which is useful for show notes. Some transcription services also include proofreading and editing."},{question:"What type of audio data can be transcribed?",answer:"Any kind of audio data can be transcribed, whether it’s from a digital audio file (MP3, WAV, AAC and so on) or from a video. The most important thing for transcription is to have a good quality recording. If the sound is muffled or inaudible, it is impossible for the transcriber to provide a complete transcript. When hiring a transcriber, check that they are happy to work with regional or international accents.This can also affect the quality of the transcript."},{question:"How can I save time when hiring a transcriber?",answer:"To save time when hiring a transcriber, follow the steps you would take to hire any professional. For example, within Fiverr, use the search functions to find transcribers who offer the specific service you want. Check their gigs to make sure they are skilled in dealing with the topic your recording covers. It’s also a good idea to ask for their price for audio minute in case it is not specified, as well as to look at reviews and star ratings so you immediately start with the top professionals. In case of doubts do not hesitate to contact Fiverr's customer service for advices or recommendations."},{question:"What is clean verbatim transcription?",answer:"Two of the types of transcription available are verbatim (or exact verbatim) transcription and clean verbatim transcription. As the name suggest, verbatim transcription includes everything that’s on the recording. So verbal tics such as “like”, “um”, “you know” and so on are included in the final transcript. Clean verbatim transcription removes the verbal tics so you get a clean transcript. Clean verbatim transcription is a good choice if you are planning to publish the transcript on a blog or website."},{question:"How long does it take to transcribe one hour of audio?",answer:"According to transcription professionals, the turnaround time to transcribe one hour of audio can be up to four hours. The transcriber has to pause the recording in order to write down what’s being said, and will listen to the recording more than once. The transcription process can take even longer if the transcriber receives a poor quality audio file, or if there are multiple speakers, or speakers who don’t speak clearly. Check that your chosen transcriber can work with international accents if this is an issue."}]},112:{faqs:[{question:"What should a resume include for a job search?",answer:"Generally a professional resume starts with your name and contact details, followed by a summary statement. After that make sure the resume writer also lists keywords that apply to your industry (these sometimes appear after the work experience section).

Then add your education, any relevant training or certifications and additional information (such as linkedin profile, career goals, volunteering, honors and awards)."},{question:"Why do you need a professional resume service?",answer:"A professionally written resume is your best chance to get the attention of a potential employer during a job interview. Most career experts who are hiring only spend a few seconds looking at a resume.

This is where it's highly advisable to find and use professional resume writing services only."},{question:"Why do resumes get rejected?",answer:"Generally a career expert spends from 5 to 9 seconds reading your resume before making a decision. If your resume gets rejected it's because it doesn't showcase how you match the position you are applying for. Poor formatting, the inclusion of non-essential information or too much information, and grammatical and spelling errors are other typical reasons for rejection. This is where getting help from a professional resume writer makes sense."},{question:"What are the most popular resume formats?",answer:"There are three main resume formats: Reverse-chronological resumes list work experiences and skills in reverse-chronological order. This is the most common resume format. Functional resumes focus on skills as opposed to chronology and work experiences. Combination resumes are hybrids of the above resume formats. They highlight your work experience in reverse-chronological order, but also have sections on your skillset. The format you choose will depend on the nature of the position you’re applying for."},{question:"How long should a resume be?",answer:"Some job advertisements specify how long they’d like your resume to be. In this case, it’s important to stick to these guidelines. If no length is specified, one or two pages is ideal. However, it’s important to remember that being concise is key—short, to-the-point resumes are preferable to lengthy resumes. This is because some vacancies receive dozens, or even hundreds, of applications. Recruiters seldom want to read through dozens of long applications that waffle or include irrelevant information."},{question:"Do I need a different resume for every job I apply to?",answer:"Ideally, yes. Since each job requires different skills and capabilities, it’s a good idea to adapt your resume depending on the job you’re applying to. For example, if you’re applying for a job in marine biology, your experience in volunteering at the aquarium would be relevant, but if you’re applying for an administrative position, you should highlight your experience as a virtual assistant.

It does NOT involve checking the flow of the copy and effectiveness of the message."},{question:"Why do I need a proofreader or copy-editor?",answer:"When you write something yourself, it's easy to see what you expect to see, so you can miss errors when checking. Someone else such as a professional proofreader or copy-editor who is not as close to the document will often spot ways to improve it."},{question:"Why is proofreading important in translation?",answer:"Machine translation is widely used in translation, but machines can't always grasp the nuances of the language. A good proofreader with years of experience will help you eliminate grammar errors or typographical errors that could completely change the meaning of your writing."},{question:"Why is proofreading important in business?",answer:"Getting copy wrong can be a costly error in business.

According to the Writer's Guild of America (WGA), screenplay writing credits are usually shared by no more than two writers or two teams of writers.

Scriptwriting generally covers what people say, such as actors in a TV show or movie, or people voicing a video. Screenwriting includes settings, camera angles, and directions, as well as the dialog.

A good script starts with an interesting plot that hooks viewers from the start. Another quality of a great script is developing the plot via a well-paced storyline.

Ghostwriters usually write on a "work for hire" basis, which means they have no rights to the finished work. Instead, the credited author owns the copyright.

Ghostwriters write a range of content, including books and ebooks; business white papers, case studies and research reports; song lyrics; and ebooks.'},{question:"What is the difference between a ghost writer and an author?",answer:"The difference between a ghostwriter and an author or co-author mostly comes down to credit. Ghostwriters don't usually receive credit for their work. They generally deliver the writing that supports the author's vision for the book. However, on some ghostwritten material, like biographies, ghostwriters are credited as having created the book \"with\" the author. Co-authors are considered jointly responsible for the content of a book, and share the copyright.

Then have a conversation to see if that ghostwriter is right for your project."},{question:"Is ghostwriting legal?",answer:"Many people wonder if ghostwriting is legal. The answer is: yes, it is. Typically, ghostwriting is work for hire, where a client agrees to buy writing services from a ghostwriter, and the ghostwriter agrees to work for a set fee. In this transaction, ghostwriters know they won't be credited for the work. Publishing houses have used ghostwriters for years. In some cases, ghostwriters help with biographies. In others, they help write book series, like the Nancy Drew and Hardy Boys books."},{question:"Do ghostwriters get royalties?",answer:"Most ghostwriters don't get royalties for their writing. With ghostwriting, the person doing the writing is not the credited author, and writes on a \"work for hire\" basis. This means the ghostwriter is paid upfront for doing the writing. Meanwhile, the credited author is the one who gets the royalties. Some people ask ghostwriters to lower their fees in exchange for a share of royalties.
